    # JavScript and Classes

    
## OOP--> Object Oriented Programming

    ##Object
    - collection of properties and methods.
    - Ex: toLowercase, toUppercase 
 

## Arts of OOP
    Object Literal (means exactly or litteraly)

    - constructor function -> Always gives a new function
    - Prototypes
    - Classes
    - Instances(new, this)
    - new keyword 
- Step1 -> whenver use a (new) keyword an empty object is created which is called instances.
- step2 -> Constructor function is called due to (new) keyword.
- step3 -> all the arguments are injected into the (this) keyword.
- step4 -> we get our functions.

## Four Pillars
    - Abstraction -  detail Hide (Ex: Fetch)
    - Encapsulation - Many forms 
    - Inheritence
    - Polymorphism
